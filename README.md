# Hello World! #

## Welcome to my portfolio project on Github.pages. ##

Thank you for taking your time to navigate here.

The short version of my story is that I was born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden. At the age of 22 I went on vacation to California and I never looked back.
I completed community College, AA with honors in Art History and conservation in 2010 as an international student. It took me three years instead of the typical two. Most was du to my english skills and being really rusty on the math. I also changed my major a few times, starting off with Journalism, then Liberal Arts to finally land on Art History where I finally felt home.

I had the intention of transferring to UCLA (that was the big dream) but logistics got in the way. In 2012 I had my first child and when it was time to go back to work I ended up as the shipping manager and assisting store manager for a scandinavian design and living store on Abbot Kinney in Venice, CA.
In 2016 I had my second child, and I got the opportunity to do Social Media ratings and eventually advanced to auditor and did quality assurance on the other raters in my work market (Swedish and English).
In 2019 I heard of a bootcamp held by St Joseph Center in Venice, CA called Codetalk. Codetalk is a vocational training program for low or no income women and after two rounds of interviews and skill test I was accepted to the program, and entered in November 2019. 
I graduated in March 2020, the very same week COVID-19 broke loose.
I was fortunate enough to been brought onboard to manage and maintain St Joseph Centers website (https://stjosephctr.org/) where my first task was to set up a new donation landing page.
Since then I have worked on several projects and campaigns. I have dipped my toes on the side doing logos for friends startups, and being creative consultant.

I am more than ready to take the next step into web development. I am just starting off in the world of programming. I would love to become a truly solid JavaScript developer and all that goes into that.

Can't wait to show the world what I'm made of.

Over and out.
